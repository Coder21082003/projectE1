        <p>Ernest Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Illinois. When he was 17, he began his career as a writer at a newspaper office in Kansas City. After the United States entered World War I, he joined a volunteer ambulance unit in the Italian army. After his return to the US, he became a reporter for American newspapers and was soon sent back to Europe. He covered many historic events such as the Spanish Civil War and World War II, including the liberation of Paris. In 1954, he survived two airplane accidents that caused severe pain for the rest of his life.</p>

                    <p>Hemingway attended Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park from 1913 until 1917. He was a good athlete,
                         involved with a number of sports—boxing, track and field, water polo, and football; performed in the school orchestra
                          for two years with his sister Marcelline; and received good grades in English classes. During his last two years at high
                          school he edited the Trapeze and Tabula (the school's newspaper and yearbook), where he imitated the language of sportswriters
                           and used the pen name Ring Lardner Jr.—a nod to Ring Lardner of the Chicago Tribune whose byline was "Line O'Type".

                    <p>Like Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist.
                        After leaving high school he went to work for The Kansas City Star as a cub reporter. Although he stayed there for only six months, 
                        he relied on the Star's style guide as a foundation for his writing: "Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous
                         English. Be positive, not negative."</p>

                    <h2>Books and Reading</h2><br>
                    <p>
                        All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you: the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was. <br>
                        -Ernest Hemingway-</p>
                        
                        <h2>Cowardice</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            Cowardice, as distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination.<br>

                    <p>
                        I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after. <br>

                    <p>Hemingway attempted suicide in the spring of 1961, and continued to receive electroconvulsive therapy (ETC). On the morning of July 2, 1961, a few weeks before his 62nd birthday, he died at his home in Ketchum, Idaho, after shooting himself in the head with a shotgun. Not yet judged mentally responsible for this final act, he was interred in a Roman Catholic cemetery. </p>

                <div class="column right">
                    <p>It is believed that Hemingway purchased the shotgun from Boss & Co., the gun he used to kill himself, at Abercrombie & Fitch - later a retailer of picnic supplies and purveyor of assorted supplies. It was a truly gruesome suicide, and he placed the stock of his double-barreled shotgun on the floor of his foyer, rested his forehead on the muzzles, and pulled the trigger. The coroner at the family's request did not conduct an autopsy.</p>
