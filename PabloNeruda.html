        <p>Pablo Neruda was born in Parral, Chile. His father opposed his interest in writing and literature, but Neruda was already working as a journalist and writer when he was 16. In 1921 he moved to Santiago to study French at the university there, but he soon began to devote himself to poetry full-time. Though Neruda made a name for himself as a poet, he remained poor, so he began working as a diplomat in Asia and Europe. He was also a senator for the Communist Party of Chile.</p>

                    <p>Born Ricardo Eliezer Neftali Reyes y Basoalto, Neruda adopted the pseudonym under which he would become famous while still in his early teens. He grew up in Temuco in the backwoods of southern Chile. Neruda’s literary development received assistance from unexpected sources. Among his teachers “was the poet Gabriela Mistral who would be a Nobel laureate years before Neruda,” reported Manuel Duran and Margery Safir in Earth Tones: The Poetry of Pablo Neruda. “It is almost inconceivable that two such gifted poets should find each other in such an unlikely spot. Mistral recognized the young Neftali’s talent and encouraged it by giving the boy books and the support he lacked at home.”

                    <p> By the time he finished high school, Neruda had published in local papers and Santiago magazines, and had won several literary competitions. In 1921 he left southern Chile for Santiago to attend school, with the intention of becoming a French teacher but was an indifferent student. While in Santiago, Neruda completed one of his most critically acclaimed and original works, the cycle of love poems titled Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada—published in English translation as Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair. This work quickly marked Neruda as an important Chilean poet.

                    <p>Matilde Urrutia Cerda (30 April 1912 – 5 January 1985) was the third wife of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, from 1966 until his death in 1973. They met in Santiago in 1946, when she was working as a physical therapist in Chile. She was the first woman in Latin America to work as a pediatric therapist. Urrutia was the inspiration behind Neruda's later love poems beginning with Los Versos del Capitan in 1951, which the poet withheld publication until 1961 to spare the feelings of his previous wife; as well as 100 Love Sonnets which includes a beautiful dedication to her.</p>

                    <p>SANTIAGO, Chile — The Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, a Nobel laureate, did not die of cancer, as his death certificate indicated, according to a group of international forensic experts who analyzed samples of his remains.

                        The conclusion, announced on Friday in Santiago, Chile’s capital, is likely to increase speculation that Neruda may have been murdered.
