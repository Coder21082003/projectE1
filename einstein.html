        <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,
            widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.
            Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
            contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum
            mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics</p>
