        <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,
            widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.
            Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
            contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum
            mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics</p>

                    <p>Einstein xuất sắc về toán học và vật lý từ khi còn nhỏ, đạt trình độ toán học trước các bạn cùng trang lứa nhiều năm. Cậu bé 12 tuổi Einstein đã tự học đại số và hình học Euclid trong một mùa hè.Einstein cũng độc lập khám phá ra bằng chứng ban đầu của riêng mình về định lý Pitago ở tuổi 12.Ở tuổi 13, khi ông quan tâm nhiều hơn đến triết học (và âm nhạc),Einstein được giới thiệu với cuốn Phê bình lý tính thuần túy của Kant . Kant trở thành nhà triết học yêu thích của anh ta, gia sư của anh ta nói rằng: "Lúc đó anh ta vẫn còn là một đứa trẻ, chỉ mới mười ba tuổi, nhưng những tác phẩm của Kant, không thể hiểu được đối với người bình thường, dường như rõ ràng đối với anh ta.".Năm 1895, ở tuổi 16, Einstein thi đầu vào trường bách khoa Liên bang Thụy Sĩ ở Zürich (sau này là Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH).Anh ta không đạt được tiêu chuẩn bắt buộc</p>

Trong khi ở với gia đình của Jost Winteler , anh ta đã yêu Marie, con gái của Winteler.Vào tháng 1 năm 1896, với sự chấp thuận của cha mình, Einstein từ bỏ quốc tịch của mình tại Vương quốc Đức Württemberg để tránh nghĩa vụ quân sự .Vào tháng 9 năm 1896, ông đậu Matura Thụy Sĩ với hầu hết các điểm tốt, bao gồm điểm cao nhất lớp 6 trong các môn vật lý và toán học, trên thang điểm 1–6 .Năm 17 tuổi, ông ghi danh vào chương trình cấp bằng giảng dạy toán và vật lý bốn năm tại trường bách khoa Liên bang. Marie Winteler, lớn hơn một tuổi, chuyển đến Olsberg , Thụy Sĩ, để giảng dạy</p>

                    <h4>Relativity</h4>
                    <p>Einstein has had a lot of research and discoveries for himself as a scientist. One of his studies that is widely used today is "the theory of relativity". This theory has changed the way the world views scientists. This research laid an important foundation for modern inventions related to nuclear and atomic energy.
                        Equation: E = mc2 (where: c is the speed of light, m ​​is a constant)
                        This is an equation that explains energy in relation to mass discovered by Einstein himself. In the theory of relativity it is said that distance and time can change due to the "relativity" of the object.</p>
                        
                    <h4>Light quantum theory</h4>
                        <p>Einstein has made a great contribution to the foundation of modern physics, which is the photon quantum theory of light.

                            In 1905, he introduced the concept of light being made up of photons. However, at that time, this view of his was rejected by scientists. Only later, more modern experiments proved that his hypothesis was correct. This is an important study for science worldwide. This important discovery won Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</p>
                            
                    <h4>Scientific work named Bose-Einstein</h4>
                    <p>Albert Einstein and scientist Satyendra Bose discovered another state of matter. It is detected as gas/liquid/solid. This is an invention that has applications in superconductors or lasers.</p>

                    <p>- In 1905, Einstein received his doctorate from the University of Zurich and published three famous scientific works soon after. This includes "special relativity".</p><br>
                    <p>- In 1907, he worked out the equivalence principle of gravity.</p><br>

                    <p>- In 1944, he was an anti-war and won $6.000.000 in funds through an auction of his handwritten "theory of special relativity".</p><br>
                    <p>- In 1949, the scientist Einstein fell ill</p><br>
                    <p>- In 1952, the Israeli government invited him to accept the position of President, but the invitation was rejected by him</p><br>
                    <p>- On April 18, 1955, Albert Einstein died in Trenton, New Jersey. Before his death, he signed a letter urging countries not to build nuclear weapons.</p><br>

                    <p>Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named "Lieserl", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that, despite their close relationship before, Einstein's chief romantic attraction was now his cousin Elsa Löwenthal;] she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally. Einstein and Marić divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed to give Marić any future (in the event, 1921) Nobel Prize money. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be." He spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. They emigrated to the United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, including Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to Elsa. Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton). Einstein's son Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally, after her death, being committed permanently to Burghölzli, the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zürich.
