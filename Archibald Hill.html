        <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,
            widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.
            Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
            contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum
            mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics</p>

                    <p>Einstein excelled at math and physics from an early age, reaching his math level many years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry for a summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own early proof of the Pythagorean theorem at the age of 12. At the age of 13, when he was much interested philosophy (and music), Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor saying: "He was still a child then, only thirteen years old, but Kant's writings, were incomprehensible to him. to the common man, it seemed obvious to him.".In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). meet the required standard</p>

In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid the Military service enrolled in a four-year math and physics teaching degree program at Federal Polytechnic.

                        <p>Einstein has had a lot of research and discoveries for himself as a scientist. One of his studies that is widely used today is "the theory of relativity". This theory has changed the way the world views scientists. This research laid an important foundation for modern inventions related to nuclear and atomic energy.
                            Equation: E = mc2 (where: c is the speed of light, m ​​is a constant)
                            This is an equation that explains energy in relation to mass discovered by Einstein himself. In the theory of relativity it is said that distance and time can change due to the "relativity" of the object.</p><br>

                        <p>Einstein has made a great contribution to the foundation of modern physics, which is the photon quantum theory of light.

                            In 1905, he introduced the concept of light being made up of photons. However, at that time, this view of his was rejected by scientists. Only later, more modern experiments proved that his hypothesis was correct. This is an important study for science worldwide. This important discovery won Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</p><br>

                        Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named
                       "Lieserl", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose
                        real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption
                        or died of scarlet fever in infancy.Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in
                        Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born on July 1910.

                    <h3>3. </h3>
                    Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly
                    in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov
                    (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton). Einstein's son Eduard had a breakdown at about
                    age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally, after
                    her death, being committed permanently to Burghölzli, the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zürich.

                        <h3>2. </h3>
                        The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to
                        Zürich with their sons after learning that, despite their close relationship before, Einstein's chief romantic attraction was now his                         cousin Elsa Löwenthal;] she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally. Einstein and Marić divorced on 14 February 
                        1919, having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed to give Marić any future (in the event, 
                        1921) Nobel Prize money. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong
                        feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare
                        minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be." He spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie. 
                        Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. They emigrated to the United States in 1933.
                        Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary 
                        named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in
                        2006, Einstein described about six women, including Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner
                        of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time 
                        and from whom he received gifts while being married to Elsa.
